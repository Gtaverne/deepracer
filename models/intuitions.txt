Here are my basic intuitions about the parameters to get in reward functions. I will mostly keep this document as a testimony about the journey.

Description                      | Complexity 5-super easy 1-lot of work| Impact 1-useless 5-essential

Following the central line | 5 | 2
Not crossing the side lines | 5 | 5
Maximizing average speed | 3 | 5
Reducing speed before turns | 3 | 3
Limiting the angle of turns (lateral g) | 3 | 4
Turning as seldom as possible | 2 | 4
Minimizing overall distance | 2 | 3
